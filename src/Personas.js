                <h1> So... Scooters? </h1>
                <p> I find the increasing popularity of electric scooters as a form of transportation fascinating. As this is a growing industry I wondered if the current user interface is efficient, usable or could be improved upon. In order to improve any interface, understanding your users behavior and goals is crucial. In this project to better understand the users, I  created two personas representing these users and illustrated a storyboard for one of these personas. </p>

                <h1>Research & Background</h1>
                <p> The first step in creating personas and a storyboard was to step into a user’s shoes as they interact with a scooter interface. To do so I observed users interact with the scooter interface, created interview questions and conducted interviews with real users. Based on the responses from the interviews I then created two personas with empathy maps and a storyboard.

                <h1>Process and Design Iterations</h1>
                <p> While I was confident in my decision to include the Late Larry persona. I also played with the idea of other persons instead of the Social Suzy persona including professors and other students. But ultimately, I decided that ultimately that the Social Suzy persona best reflected my observations and interviews. I also took inspiration from the examples in class and other online personas to decide on the format of the personas and am happy with the look of the final personas. I also created my first storyboard for my Late Larry persona, I began, stopped and restarted many times for this portion of the project but ended up hand drawing the scenario.</p>

                <h1>Conclusions & Takeaways</h1>
                <p> This project gave me better insight not only into who the users of Spin Scooters are, but also helped me better understand the principles behind the  user experience of any product. From this project I took a new way of thinking about product and interface design and was more aware of them in my everyday life.</p>
